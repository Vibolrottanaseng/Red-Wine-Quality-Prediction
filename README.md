# Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction
This Project is created and written with Jupyter Notebook. It is about predicting a good Wine Quality depend on physiochemical propeperties. In this project i use a Machine Learning technique to predict the dataset. The dataset i use is from Kaggleâ€™s Red Wine Quality. 
The ideas of the topic pop up in my head when i was going to a groceries store. I was walking pass by the beverages section and there so many kinds of red wine with different prices.I got a question to ask myself What really is a good wine? Therefore, I decided to apply a machine learning models which is Random Forest Classifier to figure out what makes a good quality wine.
